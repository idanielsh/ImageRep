# Intro
Hi, I am Daniel! Thank you for considering me for this role!

- This project highlights my full stack development experience. I used a C# backend with a SQL Server database and a React.js frontend to build this responsive web application.

- Users can add/edit/view/remove images out of the main pages in the frontend.

- In addition to main CRUD functionality, I have implemented several search functions:

    - Search based on tags
        
        - These tags (not unique) can be added and removed to and from each image. ie. a tag of dog can be linked to all images of your dog.
        
    - Search based on name
     
        - Search based on the name of the file.
        
    - Search based on description
    
        - Memories associated with certain images can be added as descriptions. We can then search for images based on particular descriptions.
